I'm a physicist working at National Centre for Nuclear Research ([NCBJ](http://ncbj.gov.pl/en)) in Poland. My research focuses on (astro-)particle theory and in particular all things **dark matter** related.

* In [Projects](http://ahryczuk.github.io/projects) description of grant projects and numerical codes
* List of [Papers](http://ahryczuk.github.io/papers) together with short descriptions and list of [Talks](http://ahryczuk.github.io/talks) with slides

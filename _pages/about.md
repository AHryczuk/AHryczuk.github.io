I'm a physicist working at National Centre for Nuclear Research [NCBJ](http://ncbj.gov.pl/en) in Poland. My research focuses on (astro-)particle theory and in particular all things **dark matter** related.

Here you'll find some information regarding myself and my research:
* In [Projects](http://ahryczuk.github.io/projects) description of research endeavours
* List and short description of [Papers](http://ahryczuk.github.io/publications) and [Talks](http://ahryczuk.github.io/talks)
* In [Teaching](http://ahryczuk.github.io/teaching) materials for education and outreach

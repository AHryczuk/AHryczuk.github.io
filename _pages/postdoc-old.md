Do you want to pursue novel research at the _intersection of particle physics and cosmology_? <br><br>
Join me to work on the project related to interconnections between dark matter production and baryogenesis, phenomenology of multi-component dark sectors and much more!

Some information about Theoretical High Energy Physics group at <a href="https://www.ncbj.gov.pl/en"> NCBJ </a> can be found <a href="https://www.ncbj.gov.pl/en/particle-theory-group"> here</a>. The offices of the Department are located on the Ochota campus not far from the city centre, neighbouring the Physics Department of the University.

Contract:
--------
* Duration: 24 months (with possible extension of 12 months)
* Starting date: Fall 2022
* Salary: about 75 000 PLN/year (net) + substantial travel budget

Qualification requirements:
--------

* PhD in theoretical particle/astroparticle physics or cosmology <br>
(obtained no earlier than in 2015)
* Research experience in BSM physics, dark matter or physics of the Early Universe
* Experience in coding and/or numerical methods is an asset
* Advanced English in writing and speaking

Application:
--------

The application, consisting of a curriculum vitae and a brief research statement, should be sent to me with the subject „postdoc 2022”. In addition, please arrange for at minimum two (but preferably three) letters of recommendation. Any other info that you find relevant (e.g., code samples, links to presentations/outreach, other non-research projects) are also welcome!

**Deadline for the application: 8 April 2022**

Invasion of Ukraine:

The horrific, inhumane war brought to the people of Ukraine by the Russian Federation left many of us trying our best to do whatever we can. If you are working/studing in Ukraine or a refugee meeting the formal requirement of a PhD in physics, then I strongly encourage you to apply. The advertised openning starts in Fall, but a shorter visit esentially immediately could be arranged as well.

If you are from a distant part of the world and a bit worried of coming to Warsaw, I hear you. There is currently no direct military threat to Poland, an EU and NATO state, but concerns for the future are understendable.


Life in Warsaw:

* It is a vibrant cosmopolitan city. Bit noisy sometimes, but also with quiet park areas, charming Old Town and a lot of things to do

* Cost of living: lower than in Western EU countries, but perhaps bit higher than you'd expect. Typical prices: monthly rent studio apartment (~1500-2000 PLN), monthly public transportation (~100 PLN), lunch at cafeteria (~20 PLN), full dinner at a restaurant (~40-60 PLN)

* Language: English is more than sufficient to live and get by - though learning some Polish words can provide useful :)

Qualification requirements:
--------

* PhD in theoretical particle/astroparticle physics or cosmology <br>
(obtained no earlier than in 2018)
* Research experience in BSM physics, dark matter or physics of the Early Universe
* Experience in coding and/or numerical methods is an asset
* Advanced English in writing and speaking

Application:

* It is a vibrant cosmopolitan city. Bit noisy sometimes, but also with quiet park areas, charming Old Town and a lot of things to do

* Cost of living: lower than in Western EU countries, but perhaps bit higher than you'd expect. Typical prices: monthly rent studio apartment (~2000-3000 PLN), monthly public transportation (~100 PLN), lunch at cafeteria (~25 PLN), full dinner at a restaurant (~40-60 PLN)

* Language: English is more than sufficient to live and get by - though learning some Polish words can provide useful :)
